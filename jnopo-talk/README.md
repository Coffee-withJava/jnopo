# JNopo Talk project

It's a project created for presentation purposes. This presentation intent to bring concepts and sample code regarding Jakarta NoSQL, Jakarta Data and Eclipse JNoSQL utilization;

This is a sample application generated by the Eclipse Foundation starter for Jakarta EE.


### Running the project

This application requires some NoSQL databases (they're described at `docker-compose.yml` file in the root dir in this project), so execute the command below to start up them:

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

You can run the application by executing the following command from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version and runtime choice (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
./mvnw clean package wildfly:run
```

If you prefer to run the UI with redeployment support, please execute the following from this directory:

```
mvn wildfly:dev --file ui/pom.xml
```

Once the server is running, the source directories are monitored for changes. If required the sources will be compiled and the deployment may be redeployed.

Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jnopo-talk.

You can also run the project via Docker. To build the Docker image, execute the following commands from the directory where this file resides. Please ensure you have installed a [Java SE 8+ implementation](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk8) appropriate for your Jakarta EE version/runtime choice and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (we have tested with Java SE 8, Java SE 11 and Java SE 17). Note, the [Maven Wrapper](https://maven.apache.org/wrapper/) is already included in the project, so a Maven install is not actually needed. You may first need to execute `chmod +x mvnw`.

```
./mvnw clean package
docker build -t jnopo-talk:v1 .
```

You can then run the Docker image by executing:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8080:8080 jnopo-talk:v1
```

Once the runtime starts, you can access the project at http://localhost:8080/jnopo-talk.
